<h2>i. Compositional Means</h2>

<p>Your film &#8220;Compilation of Genetically Modified Produce Falling from Supert Market Shelves&#8221; compiles footage of genetically modified fruits and vegtables falling from super market shelves. Genetic modification such as genes and preservatives preserve a produce&#8217;s state from decomposition for the span of time spent occupying a space on a super market shelf. This span of time is determined by when from the shelf the produce is taken off either by a human or by gravity. Because I am already familiar with the former, I am particularly interested in this film as it examines the latter. And by examine, I mean compile.</p>

<p>Genetic Modifcation does not prevent the force of gravity from shortening the span of time non-organic produce spends on a super market shelf. This is due to the piling nature by which genetically modified produce exist upon a super market shelf: a stack. This compilation shows that the process by which they are modified by genetic means of production does not &#8216;make&#8217; &#8216;them&#8217; &#8216;fit.&#8217;</p>

<p>This was easily relatable to me because most of the people I know decompose at a rate more relatable to this characteristic found in the composition of genetically modified produce rather than their organic counterparts. This past year, my father and I were drinking nonfat cappuccinos for here on the patio of our local Starbucks, which was embedded in the entrance of our local supermarket. Though the windows were covered by thick, loose sheets of translucent white plastic, I saw my reflection stretched across the glass of the pastry display, dispersed and encoded with signs signifying each product&#8217;s name and calorie content, nearly synonymous with the accompanying television and billboard campaign for this line of bran-based pastries. The promotional campaign advertised these whole grain and bran pastries as a healthier, more holistic option through the image of a nude, ethnically diverse model who held progressive standards of beauty as well as cranberry scones and blueberry muffins, which censored while echoing the lines of her cheek and waist respectively. Part of the success of this campaign was due to the flattening aspect of a digital image, the lines of the body became one with the lines of the product and thus the brand of the bran products. Over a litigious cover of Neil Young&#8217;s &#8220;Heart of Gold,&#8221; which incorporated a Steinway piano&#8217;s augmented 7th chords in place of Young&#8217;s major, the televised portion of the campaign involved the model stretching across a charcoal-grey backdrop, products appearing whenever she was about to reveal too much of herself. The commercial&#8217;s voice-over, the billboard copy, and the associated social media campaign all state with the smiling face of the ethnically diverse model: &#8220;Your Body is a Temple&#8221; and in smaller font &#8220;#WorshipYourBody.&#8221;</p>

<p>We sat down in the patio in the parking lot, and he propped his phone against one of the nonfat cappuccinos, gesturing to look at the back-facing camera. We both smiled. After he showed me the resulting image on his watch and saying how much my mother would love it, my father and I began a prolonged discussion on how we occupied our time since the last time we saw each other. When his cup hit the table, I saw something, an off-white, sink into the foam. I put my hand over his mug. Both his hands wrapped around its mouth. The shadow of a plane passed over his face. Foam speckled the stubble around his jaw. Let me have it/no. He tried to pull it from my hands. At the time, I was younger and in prime health, so I barked at him. It could have been a harmful parasitic insect, in my mind.</p>

<p>I strained the liquid through my fingers into my empty mug. After setting down the cup, I wiped off my fingers on a recycled-paper napkin and noticed that at the bottom of my father&#8217;s cup was a tooth. My father chuckled and revealed the gap left in the front of his mouth. He was sticking his tongue into the hole, laughing when he began choking. He coughed up some teeth on to the table. He stuck a fist into his mouth to pull out the teeth, but choked on his fingers. He coughed up his pinkie with his molars so hard his face hit the table. When he lifted his head, his nose had stayed behind on the table. With his one hand left, he gripped up his nose to screw it on right, turning too fast. His nose was twisted with his nostrils underneath his eyelid, and his hand was on backwards. While his hand twitched at his mouth, his hair slid from his head and inch-wormed then flickered into a crack in the pavement, brightened by some rhythm of light from passing clouds. He was out of places. Even the photos I have of him have become combinations of various parts.</p>

<p>Genetic-modification postpones the decomposition of produce in the manner by which scientific progress allowed my father to decompose at the proper time, with his son at Starbucks and espresso and foamy milk drinks. I shudder at the thought that he could have been driving down the freeway or holding a baby child or perhaps even a priceless glass bowl when his decomposition occurred. Genetically modified produce does not bruise as badly as organic produce. This makes the violence in your film palatable. Sometimes I wish for nicer clothes. Despite their mushy insides, fruits and vegetables are always appealing because of their skin.</p>

<h2>ii.Auto-discourse</h2>

<p>Image-making begins with framing. Forming a frame of reference establishes the contextual framework in which the networked existence of your film Compilation of Genetically Modified Produce Falling from Supermarket Shelves functions. Never is this more apparent than in how the digital stills of the film, once printed on a material either that is or recalls the material of analog film exist in a stack. Piling the initial frame of each scene in Compilation of Genetically Modified Produce Falling From Super Market Shelves like pages in a transparent book shows how these images are linked, encoded, and wired in a discernible frame or network that recalls the word &#8220;produce.&#8221; Once backlit by an LED the produce, centered in the frame while in the trajectory of falling, all recall the ideal produce: an item with attributes familiar, yet upon scrutiny, individually all together unrecognizable.</p>

<p>Keeping this in mind, we can understand how the accumulation of these images and the representation of the ideal produce recalls how such an understanding can be utilized as a model or stage on which to situate our conjecture of the commonality among each individual produce&#8217;s molecular substructure. In addition, the produce all have in common that they exist on a supermarket shelf off of which they fall.</p>

<p>Producing a context for the film involves invoking the aisles of the supermarket not in of its spatial attributes but in terms of the sequential relations produced between genetically modified, the floor, and the shelves. In this speculation, a consumer in the genetically modified produce section would either hear a sound from behind that carries over the popular music in the background or has identified motion of a yet to be identified object in his periphery. Investigating this identity with his hands and knees against the linoleum of the floor, he turns on his LED headlamp so that the light shines into the space between the shelves and the floor. The LED manifests the attributes of the object as a tomato while producing an elongated shadow of the produce that carries across the floor and the bottom of the shelve it has rolled under. By making apparent, the consumer&#8217;s illumination produces the individuality of the produce: a genetically modified tomato that has fallen from a super market shelf. In the moment of falling, however, this was familiar, yet all together unrecognizable: only a genetically modified produce even when on a super market shelf.</p>

<p>From here, the attraction of accumulation becomes apparent in the identification of the cause of this sensation. The visual merchandising display strategy of the super market as it exists in this speculation of the ideal involves blurring the line between recognizable individual attributes by creating an environment of simultaneity. An item taken from such a shelf, the consumer finds comfort in the fact there will be one behind it. The choice is made because the removal is negated; the consumer minutely impacts the environment. At the same time, the first impression of an aisle is one where the products conform together through their initial abstraction as blocks of color. Initially, the consumer is unable to discern individuality among the products or perhaps even to identify results in the generalization and/ or synthesis of the visual products; the consumer is attracted to the color of the advertisement for the product before the actual product. For this reason, purchasing the product, one initially and thus primarily purchases the product&#8217;s ideal.</p>

<p>The consumer cradled the product illuminated by his LED in his grip. The tomato bubbled. Discerning the flaws, his grip flexing and relaxing. The violence was palpable: red pulp underneath his fingernails, red fluid down his palm, his forearm, fluid down his wrist, staining his white button-up in the folds of his rolled up sleeves, down between his fingers, falling on to the supermarket floor. An employee arrived to mop up the mess. Another handed him paper towels, asking if he got any tomato on him. The employee squinted as the consumer replied. The consumer handed him the tomato and turned off his LED headlamp. After being marked on the waste list among recalled items, the tomato would register as profit as the consumer lifted a 12-pack of Smart Water for the cashier to scan with a mobile barcode scanner. The name and price going unrecognized in the swathe of names of brand products, Genetically Modified produce, and each items corresponding price on the LED screen.</p>

<p>It was not until later that night when in a dark room while an LED shined brightly into the consumer&#8217;s eyes that this became apparent. He was shaking his colleague&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>—Wait a minute what&#8217;s this? A &#8220;Fresh Vine-Ripened Tomato&#8221;</p>

<p>The colleague began to laugh.</p>

<p>—Oh no! Don&#8217;t tell me you went all day like this.</p>

<p>The consumer chuckled in response.</p>

<p>—I suppose I did.</p>

<p>They were laughing shaking each other&#8217;s hands. They were both enlightened; their headlamps dilated their eyes.</p>

<p>—Well I guess that makes you a &#8220;Fresh Vine-Ripened Tomato.&#8221;</p>

<p>—Oh ho ho!</p>

<p>Removing his hand, the consumer found two beige colored pills in his palm.</p>

<p>—Are these the one&#8217;s you mentioned last week?</p>

<p>—Yeah a cocktail with a little bit of acai, a little chia seeds, goji berries, cacao and salmon oil</p>

<p>The consumer threw the pills into his throat where they stayed.</p>

<p>—You mentioned you felt you think you have ADHD last week?</p>

<p>—No, my wife and I think our son might. Do you know where I can grab some water?</p>

<p>—Definitely pick up some of this.</p>

<p>The colleague took out a plastic tube from his pocket.</p>

<p>—Just rub some of this condensed coconut oil underneath his nostrils before he goes to bed, like so.</p>

<p>He squirted the oil and rubbed it across his upper lip. His nostrils became iridescent in the light of the consumer&#8217;s LED.</p>

<p>—It&#8217;ll even out his breathing while he sleeps. He&#8217;ll be able to concentrate more in school.</p>

<p>—Thanks. I&#8217;m just going to grab some water.</p>

<p>Several LEDs passed behind his colleague&#8217;s head, twinkling in the dark.</p>

<p>—It looks like we&#8217;re about to start.</p>

<p>They took their seats with their other colleagues in the circle and turned off their LEDs</p>

<p>A LED turned on.</p>

<p>—Welcome, everyone. It&#8217;s great to see you all. Well tonight, we have a ton of presentations to get through tonight. But first, I can see there are a few new users among all of your bright faces. I would like you all to consider how each of these stories we&#8217;re about to hear tonight, despite each presentation&#8217;s unique characteristics, demonstrates how the everyday application of an LED headlamp makes the world more convenient for us and is absolutely necessary for progress and to further our ideals. And with that, the first member has a great story for us.</p>

<p>The LED turned off. A LED turned on.</p>

<p>—Hey, it&#8217;s great to back among you all again. For many of us here, the only thing more important than our mission and our personal livelihoods as well as our individual betterment is, of course, our family. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m not the only one here when I say—I&#8217;m sorry, but I would do anything, anything to protect the bodies of my children and of my beautiful wife. Let me just stop and say I&#8217;ve been coming here since the baptism of my youngest daughter, so I could be a better father. She just turned 11 last week, so it&#8217;s been…</p>

<p>—Too long! Ho ho!</p>

<p>It was a different voice. A LED turned on. A LED turned off</p>

<p>—For our new members, I&#8217;d like to remind you to please maintain our group&#8217;s decorum. If you have something to say, please wait until the headlamp of the person speaking turns off. I&#8217;m sorry please forgive the disturbance and continue.</p>

<p>The LED turned off. A LED turned on</p>

<p>— Ho ho! Yes— I suppose you&#8217;re right. It has been a long time. Maybe too long. However, in all my years pursuing this mission- our mission- I have never felt so- pardon me, I&#8217;m sorry- I have never felt so blessed to be an LED headlamp user as I have today.</p>

<p>This past week, my family and I had just seen Jersey Boys at the Orpheum, a great show. We were walking through the tenderloin. We had stayed through the encore. It was as dark as this room and—well, you all know the area, so I won&#8217;t go into out I was feeling. I couldn&#8217;t remember where I&#8217;d parked the car and though my girls are growing into young adults, I could tell they were becoming frightened. Maybe it&#8217;s my paternal instinct, but through the fog, a hooded homeless man approached us behind the fog asking us for money. My girls burst into tears as my wife started screaming, &#8220;Just give him what he wants!&#8221; As I reached for my wallet, my instinct just kicked in. I made as if to hand him money when I quickly strobed my LED directly into the assailant&#8217;s eyes, temporarily stunning and blinding the assailant. I turned to my family and commanded them to &#8220;run!&#8221; As they made their way to safety, a patrol car had noticed my flashing LED through the fog and tackled the man to the pavement as he started to spasm. Foam speckled the stubble around his jaw. He was twitching when the hand cuffs were put on his wrists. I still remember all the jokes my family used to make about my LED headlamp, but now, I&#8217;m happy to say they&#8217;re all users and are here with us tonight.</p>

<p>The LED turned off. The LEDs strobed on and off then stopped.</p>

<p>A LED turned on. The voice underneath:</p>

<p>—Hello everyone. It&#8217;s great to see all of your smiling faces again. I and one of our fellow users in Hamburg have been developing this &#8220;lifehack&#8221; that we believe will really help our mission out, especially during these warm summer months when we will be sleeping with our windows open. Though there seems to be some division among us concerning whether or not to sleep with your LED headlamp and whether or not the benefits—being able to find a glass of water at night without turning on the kitchen light or protecting our property by tricking possible burglars into thinking that we are awake (in my neighborhoods where there are large amounts of hooded men who could knock down the door at any second)—outweigh the costs— difficulty falling asleep and often, attracting moths to gather around our faces.</p>

<p>The good news is that email pen pal and I have developed across a simple solution for this case involving an item that&#8217;s underneath your sink. I just need a volunteer so you all can see.</p>

<p>The LED swayed.</p>

<p>—If one of you could just strobe your LED, so I know.</p>

<p>The LED swayed then fixed upon an LED blinking on and off. As the LED moved closer, a smiling woman appeared. There is herself and a male body over her illuminated. The hands snap a plastic grocery bag open. Her mouth opens wide. The hands pull the bag over her head and tie a knot around her neck. Her mouth gapes beneath the plastic, stretching around her teeth. A hand pierces a pair of scissors through her mouth and the thinned plastic. The mouth was gaping, silent. No words and empty. Then a groan rattled through her throat but an imitation of sleeping. Her snores grew louder.</p>

<p>The LED turned off. The LEDs strobed on and off then stopped.</p>

<p>An LED turned on.</p>

<p>— LEDs allow us to manifest the world as we see fit. What I mean to demonstrate or rather relate through my life, a demonstration, or rather in this relation of my demonstration that is a demonstration is my life is that a certain relation can be suggested with one’s mental faculty and the utilization of the LED. My space is like the room I sit in now. My room in my space lacks windows and the leakage of light underneath doorways is prevented through the removal of all conventional sources of light in my space. Light can be like water. The only source of light allowed to remain is the LED attached to my head. I use it at my discretion. Living between sundown and sunset, my room&#8217;s only source of light is my LED headlamp. I need only to express the desire for a chair, turn on my headlamp to the point of a chair, and a chair appears. I enjoy this. When I am hungry, I go to my refrigerator. I turn on my LED as the refrigerator light bulb is removed and food appears. When I need to sleep, I move to my room, I turn on my LED and a bed appears. Even some times an audience.</p>

<p>The LED turned off.</p>

<p>The remaining LEDs turned on.</p>

<p>When someone came in or left, the door to the meeting hall was left open on to the night. A breeze came through the illuminated door. Faint padded sputtering slowly came into being. A series of black dogs, amalgamated into a sprawling, multiple total, formed themselves into the room. Their millipeding legs fanning out stretching from the body. Black fur and black paws circled around the table of after meeting snacks; a punch bowl of vitamins and a collection of reflective refreshments spread upon a highlighter yellow table cloth dotted with scotch lite silhouettes of various fruits and vegetables that with the aid of an LED headlamp impressed themselves upon the eyes in a grid whenever reaching for something to eat. But their brightness was muted/overpowered by the LEDs refracting the glint of the black dogs with the white teeth and the black fur and the red mouths.</p>

<p>Despite their affordability and brightness, LED lighting provides many problems when used to capture moving images. When recording an image at a higher frame rate, a strobing effect occurs. This strobing effect is one of the reasons for the LED&#8217;s affordability. In addition to its bluish tinge, which creates an imitation of fear upon white faces, the strobing effect is one of the reasons why LED lighting is not solely used in recording moving images such as those in your film Compilation of Genetically Modified Produce Falling from Super Market Shelves.</p>

<p>It became gradually more pronounced as the black dogs mounted the table of light post-meeting refreshments. The sounds of the night mixed with the chewing and licking of the black dogs. And there were no sounds but chewing. Each expected the other to speak, but no one had permission. They wondered who would reprimand them, but they would first have to speak about the dogs before speaking about discipline for talking out of turn. It was assumed someone else would have something to say about this, anyone but themselves. Someone should really do something about the paws in the punchbowls, the noses in the genetically modified produce, or the teeth in the foamy frosting of the platter of cupcakes. Tails knocked over stacks of cups, bowls of vitamins, platters clanged onto the floor, pieces of cold cuts falling in their fur. There was a flickering of the LEDs and abrupt dimmings. This repeated. While tails were bitten and tangled with one another, the glass bowl of punch fell from the table and splintered spreading red on to the floor.</p>

<p>Their batteries were dying. They stared for hours. They thought it was an imitation of itself as the last batteries died.</p>

<p>As more Super Markets are seeing the cost-cutting benefits of LED lighting and are gradually being integrated into the retail environment, Compilation of Genetically Modified Produce Falling from Super Market Shelves is truly of the moment. The contrast of fluorescent and LED lighting sources cause the compiled produce to spasm and twitch in its descent. They fall but never hit the floor, the linoleum. Visualizing the mental mapping of the produce and the supermarket shelves would be similar to a partially rendered sine curve in which the highest points are only graphed to the nadir, a series of reversed long s&#8217;s. The compilation&#8217;s perpetual motion of the images of a perpetual motion accumulates in a small pile but only in the mind.</p>
